Full-stack application featuring a Flask API backend and a React Native frontend

Full-Stack Password Reset System
This project is a full-stack application featuring a Flask API backend and a React Native frontend (to be added). The application enables secure password reset functionality, rate-limited API endpoints, and integration with Redis for caching and API request limiting.

Features:
🛠️ Backend: Flask REST API with endpoints for user authentication and password reset.
📩 Password Reset: Generates secure reset codes with expiration logic.
⚙️ Redis Integration: Used for caching and rate limiting via Flask-Limiter.
🛡️ Rate Limiting: Protects API routes from abuse with configurable request thresholds.
📱 Frontend (React Native): A mobile interface for user interactions (in progress).
🐳 Dockerized Deployment: Fully containerized backend and Redis setup for seamless local and production deployment.

Technologies Used:
Flask (Python) for backend development.
Redis for caching and rate limiting.
Docker for containerized services.
React Native (planned) for mobile application development.
Expo (planned) for a streamlined mobile development experience.
